		<h1>Accessible Tabs and Accordions</h1>
		
		<p>Both tabs and accordions show and hide content after user initiation. When stripped down to their most basic form, each toggle element can be semantically represented as a heading followed by content relating to that heading. For this reason, the markup must begin in this way for progressive enhancement. Doing this allows the content to make the most sense when no JavaScript is available, when viewed in text only browsers (like <a href="http://www.webbie.org.uk/">WebbIE</a>), and when displaying all content expanded in the print stylesheet. It also lends itself to displaying expanded for large screen displays and compacting to an accordion layout for smaller screens only which can be a better user experience for some content.</p>
		
		<p>With progressive enhancement, JavaScript is added to condense the content into its tab or accordion container. To be accessible, the accordion triggers and tabs must be keyboard friendly. It is also important to use ARIA to give screen readers more information about what content is being displayed.</p>
				
		<h2>Accordion anytime, anywhere</h2>
		<p>This is your classic accordion that always acts like an accordion no matter what size screen resolution.</p>
